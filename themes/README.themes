Theme requires that you have layout.html file present. No other requirements.

It is recommended though to have separate style.css file that does all the
styling for your theme. The Revolution theme is the reference that is maintained
by the OGP admins.

It is also recommended to validate the layout with followign command:
$ tidy -i -m layout.html
